        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About the service</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body"><%= service_name -%> is a service provided by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ).</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Its purpose is to help users work out whether or not they need to tell organisations (such as employers, places of education or insurance companies) about a caution or conviction on their criminal record.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The service gives users guidance on when a single caution or conviction becomes spent, according to the current law in England and Wales.</p>
        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
          If you have more than one conviction, the guidance the service gives may not apply to you.
        </div>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you have been given another conviction during your rehabilitation period, or if you are applying for certain sensitive jobs, the guidance will not apply.</p>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How the service works</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">The service asks users for:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>their age when cautioned or convicted</li>
          <li>the type of caution or conviction they were given</li>
          <li>any relevant dates and sentence lengths, if applicable</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">This information is checked against the current law on rehabilitation periods and users are given the date the conviction becomes spent.</p>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="using-guidance">How to use the information this service gives you</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">As the service does not ask for specific details about users’ criminal records, it can only give general guidance on when cautions or convictions become spent in England and Wales.</p>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
          <p class="govuk-body">If you will be using the guidance given by this service to decide whether or not to disclose a caution or conviction on your criminal record, you are strongly advised to consider getting specific professional or legal advice before doing so.</p>
        </div>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Our responsibilities</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">The result given at the end of the service is based on the information inputted by the service user.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If the user inputs any incorrect information, the result they are given at the end will also be incorrect.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">MoJ is not responsible for:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>people disclosing spent cautions or convictions when they weren’t required to</li>
          <li>how and when employers ask for information about people’s criminal records</li>
        </ul>
