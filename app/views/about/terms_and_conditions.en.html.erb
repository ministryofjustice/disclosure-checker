            <p class="govuk-body">Check when a caution or conviction expires is a service provided by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ).</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Its purpose is to help users work out whether or not they need to tell organisations (such as employers, places of education or insurance companies) about a caution or conviction on their criminal record.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">The service gives users guidance on when a single caution or conviction expires (becomes ‘spent’) according to the current law in England and Wales.</p>
            <div class="govuk-inset-text">
              If you have more than one conviction, the guidance the service gives may not apply to you.
            </div>
            <p class="govuk-body">If you have been given another conviction during your rehabilitation period, or if you are applying for certain sensitive jobs, the guidance will not apply.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">The service asks users for:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>the type of caution or conviction they were given</li>
              <li>the date they were cautioned or convicted</li>
              <li>their age when cautioned or convicted</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">This information is checked against the current law and users are given the date the conviction expires.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Some organisations will still need to know about cautions and convictions that have expired, depending on the application that’s being made.</p>

            <p class="govuk-body">As the service does not ask for specific details about users’ criminal records, it can only give general guidance on when cautions or convictions become spent in England and Wales.</p>

               <p class="govuk-body">If you will be using the guidance given by this service to decide whether or not to disclose a caution or conviction on your criminal record, you are strongly advised to consider getting specific professional or legal advice before doing so.</p>
