          Help us test a new service to help people with disclosing convictions
        </h1>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          The User-Centred Policy Design (UCPD) team at the Ministry of Justice has been looking at ways to improve the information and guidance available to people with criminal records.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          Our research has shown people don’t always understand:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>what convictions they’ve been given</li>
          <li>when convictions will become spent</li>
          <li>if and when they need to disclose convictions to people</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          To help people understand their criminal records, we’ve working on an online service that calculates when cautions or convictions become spent.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          The aim is to help people find out whether they need to disclose cautions or convictions to organisations such
          as employers, colleges or insurance companies.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          We’ve also published <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/telling-people-about-your-criminal-record">some detailed guidance about disclosing criminal records</a> on GOV.UK.
        </p>

          About the service we’re piloting
        </h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          <strong><%= service_name -%></strong> asks people what type of caution or conviction they were given and when. It then gives the user the date on which it becomes spent.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          The service is:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>free to use</li>
          <li>written in plain English</li>
          <li>run by the Ministry of Justice</li>
          <li>compliant with government’s online accessibility standards</li>
          <li>completely anonymous (we don’t ask for any personal details that can be used to identify someone)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
          The service does not yet include motoring offences and currently calculates only one caution or conviction at a time. We’re planning to add motoring offences as well as the ability to calculate multiple convictions later.

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
          How you can help
        </h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          We’re now at the stage where we’d like people across the country to start interacting with the service. We hope that the service will help explain:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>the type of caution or conviction given</li>
          <li>when the caution or conviction becomes spent</li>
          <li>what to do with the results</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
          What we’d like to know
        </h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          We’re really interested in finding out whether people understand:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>what the service is for</li>
          <li>the questions we’re asking</li>
          <li>what they can do with the results</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
          What you need to know
        </h2>

         As the service is currently being piloted, we cannot guarantee that the result given at the end of the service will be correct.
