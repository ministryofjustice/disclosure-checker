    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      As you’ve not given specific details about your caution or conviction, this service can only give you
      general guidance about when it becomes spent.
    <p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The result you’ve been given might be wrong if you:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>entered any incorrect information, such as approximate dates</li>
      <li>did not serve your sentence in full as the court ordered you to, or</li>
      <li>did not stick to the conditions of your sentence</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      Some spent cautions and convictions are
      <a class="govuk-link" rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-filtering-guidance">’protected’ or ‘filtered’</a> and
      will not show up on a standard or enhanced criminal record check.
