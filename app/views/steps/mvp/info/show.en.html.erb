          Help us test a new service for young ex-offenders
        </h1>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          Over the past few months, the User-Centred Policy Design (UCPD) team at the Ministry of Justice has been
          looking at ways to improve the information and guidance available to young offenders.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          Our research has shown that young offenders often don’t understand:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>what convictions they’ve been given</li>
          <li>when convictions will become spent</li>
          <li>if and when they need to disclose convictions to people</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          To help young offenders understand their criminal records, we’ve started working on an online service that
          helps people check when their cautions or convictions become spent.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          The aim is to help people find out whether they need to disclose cautions or convictions to organisations such
          as employers, colleges or insurance companies.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          Some YOTs have already contributed towards this service and we’re really grateful for all the feedback and
          advice we’ve been given. Much of it has already been used to make improvements.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
          About the service
        </h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          '<%= service_name -%>' asks people what type of caution or conviction they were given and when they were given
          it. It then gives the user the date on which it becomes spent.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          Benefits of the service include it being:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>free to use</li>
          <li>written in plain English</li>
          <li>run by the Ministry of Justice</li>
          <li>compliant with government’s online accessibility standards</li>
          <li>completely anonymous (we don’t ask for any personal details that could identify an ex-offender)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
          The service currently calculates only one caution or conviction at a time. We’re planning to add the ability
          to calculate multiple convictions later.
        </div>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
          How you can help
        </h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          We’re now at the stage where we’d like young people across the country to start interacting with the service,
          with the support of their YOT worker.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          <strong>
            We’d like to ask if you could take a few minutes to walk as many young people as possible through the
            service to find out when their cautions or convictions become spent.
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          This could be used as part of your existing process for when a young person is coming to the end of their time
          with the YOT.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          The service can be used to help you explain:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>what type of caution or conviction someone was given</li>
          <li>when the caution or conviction becomes spent</li>
          <li>who is entitled to know this information once it becomes spent</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          The fact that it’s run by MOJ should help people trust the information they’re given, and means that it will
          be instantly updated whenever there are any changes in policy or law.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
          What we’d like to know
        </h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          We’re really interested in finding out if young people understand:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>what the service is for</li>
          <li>the questions we’re asking</li>
          <li>what they can do with the information they’re given at the end</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          We’re also really keen to get your feedback as a YOT worker with a lot of expertise in this field. We
          especially need to know if the result given at the end of the service is incorrect.
