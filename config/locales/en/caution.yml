            <p>You can enter a future date if you know when your conditions will end. The date your caution becomes spent will be correct as long as you stick to the conditions of your caution.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">If the conditions last less than 3 months</h2>
            <p>Your caution will be spent on the day the conditions end.</p>
            <p>If one of the conditions is to pay a fine or compensation, your caution will be spent on the day that all the conditions end - including paying the financial penalty in full.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">If the conditions last 3 months or more</h2>
            <p>Your caution will be spent 3 months after the day the caution was given to you.</p>
