      # a previous question, so with this solution we can't know where to link.
      # In order for this to work we could:
      #   a) refactor this form into 2 separate forms
      #   b) add logic (and thus complexity) to `error_helpers.rb`
      #   c) handle the focus with javascript? (controversial)
